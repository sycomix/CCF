Member Governance
=================

This section describes how a consortium of trusted :term:`members` governs an existing CCF network. It explains how members can submit proposals to CCF and how these proposals are accepted based on the rules defined in the :term:`constitution`.

Before creating a new CCF network, the identity of the initial member(s) of the consortium must be generated.

The ``CCF/tests/keygenerator.sh`` script can be used to generate the member's certificate and associated private key as well as their key share public and private keys. For example, to generate the first member's information:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ CCF/tests/keygenerator.sh --name=member1 --gen-key-share
    -- Generating identity private key and certificate for participant "member1"...
    Identity curve: secp384r1
    Identity certificate generated at:   member1_cert.pem (to be registered in CCF)
    Identity private key generated at:   member1_privk.pem
    -- Generating key share pair for participant "member1"...
    Key share public key generated at:   member1_kshare_pub.pem (to be registered in CCF)
    Key share private key generated at:  member1_kshare_priv.pem

.. note:: See :ref:`developers/cryptography:Algorithms and Curves` for the list of supported cryptographic curves.

The member's private key (e.g. ``member1_privk.pem``) should be stored on a trusted device while the certificate (e.g. ``member1_cert.pem``) and public key share (e.g. ``member1_kshare_pub.pem``) should be given to operators before starting the first node of a new CCF network.
